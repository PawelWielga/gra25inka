# Urodzinowi Milionerzy

This repository contains the original version of the birthday-themed quiz game. The project uses simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any build tools.

## Running Locally
1. Start a static HTTP server in the project directory. For example:
   ```
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Bootstrap and jQuery are loaded from public CDNs, which also provide the font files used for Glyphicons.
An Internet connection is therefore required when running the game.
